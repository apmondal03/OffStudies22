/**
 * Data model for the Young Learners tier (ages ~7-12) — a bridge between
 * Kids Mode (pre-readers) and the adult CEFR track. Unlike Kids Mode, this
 * content DOES use the generic adult ContentModule system
 * (`useModuleStream`/`useModuleProgress`/`lib/registry.ts`), registered
 * with `track: "kids"` — a 7-12 year old can read, so the Stream mechanic
 * fits, it just needs its own calmer visual theme and simpler content.
